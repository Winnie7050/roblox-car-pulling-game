# ServerScriptService

This directory contains all server-side scripts that will be placed in ServerScriptService in your Roblox game.

Server scripts handle game logic that should not be accessible to clients, such as:
- Game state management
- Car spawning and physics properties
- Player progression and data saving
- Security-critical operations
