# StarterPlayerScripts

This directory contains all client-side scripts that will be placed in StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts in your Roblox game.

These scripts run on the client and handle things such as:
- Local player input
- UI interaction
- Visual effects
- Client-side prediction
- Character animation control

Scripts in this folder are copied to each player's PlayerScripts when they join the game.
